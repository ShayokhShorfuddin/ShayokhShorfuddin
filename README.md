Hello there! 👋 I am Shayokh, a front-end web developer on a mission to build a better, accessible web for everyone. 🌍

I love checking out brand-new techs/frameworks and studying optimization techniques. ⚡ Mostly comfortable with NextJs 15, React, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, Sass, and a few more..

I never fail to admire a modern, sleek UI and find it delightful to paint them on the blank canvas of browsers. Who knows? Someday, I might end up being a UI Designer alongside a front-end developer. 😅

Anyway, I am also capable of building mobile applications using React Native ⚛️ However, front-end web development is my comfy zone.
