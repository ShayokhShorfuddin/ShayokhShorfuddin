Hello there! I am Shayokh, a front-end web developer on a mission to build a better, accessible web for everyone.

I love checking out brand-new techs/frameworks and studying optimization techniques. Mostly comfortable with NextJs 15, React, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, Sass, and a few more..

I never fail to admire a modern, sleek UI and find it delightful to paint them on the blank canvas of browsers. Anyway, I am also capable of building mobile applications using React Native. However, front-end web development is my comfy zone.

Wait a sec, did I mention that I know Morse code?
